# Search-Filter
Excited to share Search Feature! I’ve implemented an easy-to-use search filter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This feature allows users to quickly filter lists and data for a better browsing experience. Building this challenged me to make the UI both functional and visually clean, and I learned more about effective DOM manipulation and styling.
